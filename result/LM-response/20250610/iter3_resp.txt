  "explanation": "Analysis of the last seven attempts shows that decreasing configuredMaxTxPower from 26 to 24 and then to 25 resulted in improved energy efficiency. However, the target of 800000 bit/joule was not met. Further decreasing configuredMaxTxPower to 22 is proposed to continue improving energy efficiency.",
