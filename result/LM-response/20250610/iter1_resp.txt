  "explanation": "Analysis of the Strategy History indicates that increasing configuredMaxTxPower from 25 to 30 resulted in a decrease in energy efficiency from 791233.9999999992 to 676956.4125000001. This suggests that the optimal value for configuredMaxTxPower may be between 25 and 30. Therefore, we propose increasing configuredMaxTxPower to 26 to further improve energy efficiency.",
