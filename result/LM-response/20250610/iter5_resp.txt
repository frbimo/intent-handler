  "explanation": "Analysis of the last seven attempts shows that decreasing configuredMaxTxPower from 26 to 23 led to an improvement in energy efficiency from 788055 to 795809.9999999997. However, increasing it from 22 to 24 resulted in a slight decrease from 797432.9999999995 to 793777.0000000013. Given the target is not yet met, we will try to find a balance by setting configuredMaxTxPower to 24, which is slightly higher than the most recent value of 23 but lower than the value of 26 that led to a significant decrease in energy efficiency.",
