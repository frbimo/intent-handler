  "explanation": "Analysis of the Strategy History indicates that decreasing configuredMaxTxPower from 26 to 24 and then to 22 resulted in improved energy efficiency from 788055 to 793777 and then to 797432.9999999995, respectively. This trend suggests that further decreasing configuredMaxTxPower within the allowed range may lead to improved energy efficiency. Therefore, we propose decreasing configuredMaxTxPower to 23.",
