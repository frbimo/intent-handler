  "explanation": "Analysis of the Strategy History indicates that decreasing configuredMaxTxPower from 26 to 25 resulted in a slight improvement in energy efficiency (788055.0000000002 to 791233.9999999992). However, increasing it to 30 led to a significant decrease in energy efficiency (676956.4125000001). Therefore, we will continue to refine the configuredMaxTxPower parameter by decreasing it to 24, within the allowed range, to potentially improve energy efficiency further.",
