  "explanation": "Given the intent target of improving RANEnergyEfficiency to be greater than 810000 bit/joule and the current energy efficiency being 765493.0000000001 bit/joule, the PowerOptimization strategy is chosen. Reducing the configuredMaxTxPower from 30 to 20 is expected to improve energy efficiency while potentially impacting throughput. This adjustment aims to strike a balance between energy efficiency and performance, aligning with the operator's intent.",
