  "explanation": "Based on the strategy history, decreasing configuredMaxTxPower consistently improved energy efficiency until RUN #5, where it reached a peak of 803257.9999999999 bit/joule. Further decrease in RUN #6 led to a decrease in energy efficiency. Since the target energy efficiency of 810000 bit/joule is not met and decreasing the parameter further does not yield improvement, it is reasonable to give up on this strategy type.",
