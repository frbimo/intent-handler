  "explanation": "Based on the Strategy History, decreasing configuredMaxTxPower consistently led to improved energy efficiency. Since the last run (RUN #4) showed a slight improvement with a configuredMaxTxPower of 12, we will further decrease it to 11, staying within the allowed range of 10-30, to attempt to reach the target energy efficiency of 810000 bit/joule.",
