  "explanation": "Based on the Strategy History, decreasing configuredMaxTxPower consistently led to improved energy efficiency. Since the last run (RUN #5) showed a slight improvement from 12 to 11, further decreasing to the minimum allowed value of 10 is proposed to potentially achieve better energy efficiency.",
