  "explanation": "Analysis of the Strategy History indicates that decreasing configuredMaxTxPower consistently improves energy efficiency. RUN #2 and RUN #3 show a significant increase in energy efficiency when configuredMaxTxPower is decreased from 30 to 25 and then to 20, respectively. However, RUN #4 shows a slight decrease in energy efficiency when configuredMaxTxPower is increased to 22. Therefore, it is reasonable to continue decreasing configuredMaxTxPower within the allowed range to further improve energy efficiency.",
