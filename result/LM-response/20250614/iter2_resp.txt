  "explanation": "Analysis of the Strategy History indicates that decreasing configuredMaxTxPower from 30 to 25 to 20 led to consistent improvements in energy efficiency, from 765493 to 791234 to 799757 bit/joule. Given this trend, further decreasing configuredMaxTxPower within the allowed range is expected to yield additional improvements. The new value of 22 is chosen as a moderate step down from 20, aiming to balance the potential for increased energy efficiency with the risk of over-optimization.",
