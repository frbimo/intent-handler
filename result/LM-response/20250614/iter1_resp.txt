  "explanation": "Analysis of the Strategy History indicates that decreasing configuredMaxTxPower from 30 to 25 led to an improvement in energy efficiency from 765493 to 791234 bit/joule. This suggests that further reduction in configuredMaxTxPower may yield additional improvements. Therefore, configuredMaxTxPower is decreased to 20, which is within the allowed range of 10 to 30.",
