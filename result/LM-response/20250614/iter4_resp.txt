  "explanation": "Analysis of the Strategy History indicates that decreasing configuredMaxTxPower from 30 to 25 (RUN #2) and then to 20 (RUN #3) led to improvements in energy efficiency. However, increasing it from 20 to 22 (RUN #4) resulted in a slight decrease in energy efficiency, and decreasing it further to 21 (RUN #5) showed a slight improvement. This suggests that the optimal value for configuredMaxTxPower is likely between 20 and 22. Therefore, we propose increasing it to 24 to explore if further improvements can be achieved within the allowed range.",
