-- Streaming response --
Based on the provided instructions, I will generate the JSON output. Since there are no past attempts, the output will be empty.

```
{
  "result": {
    "relevant_attempts": []
  },
  "explanation": "No past attempts found for RANEnergyEfficiency",
  "error": null
}
```

Explanation:

* Since there are no past attempts, the `relevant_attempts` array is empty.
* The `explanation` field indicates that no past attempts were found for the specified intent type (`RANEnergyEfficiency`).
* The `error` field is null, indicating that no errors occurred during the filtering process.
