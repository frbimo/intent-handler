Based on the provided instructions, I will generate the JSON output. Since the past attempts list is empty, the output will reflect that.

```
{
  "result": {
    "relevant_attempts": []
  },
  "explanation": "No past attempts found for RANEnergyEfficiency intent type.",
  "error": null
}
```

Explanation:

* Since the past attempts list is empty, there are no attempts to filter or rank.
* The `relevant_attempts` list is empty, indicating that no relevant attempts were found.
* The `explanation` string indicates that no past attempts were found for the specified intent type.
* The `error` field is null, indicating that no errors occurred during the analysis.
